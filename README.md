# Quantum Playground

A beginner-friendly quantum project demonstrating fundamental concepts: superposition, entanglement, and noise.

## Key Demonstrations:
- **Superposition:** Visualizing a qubit between |0> and |1> states on the Bloch sphere
- **Entanglement:** Demonstrating a circuit entangling two qubits
- **Noise:** Graphically showing how noise affects entanglement
- **Teleportation:** Demonstarting the teleportation of one qubit's information to another

## How to Run
1. Install [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)
2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter
3. Run each notebook to see the visualizations

## Notes
- AI-assisted coding was used to build this playground
- Beginner-level project for learning quantum fundamentals
